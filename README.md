### What is this anyway ?
This is a LAB application. It's not finished and it might never be! It has some bugs for sure!

The underlying idea around this application is to make a collaborative drawing application. I've been stuck at the moment to the lack of capabilities related to the TextField component but you'll never now openfl team might fix it someday :)
